Hi, I am currently studying Electrical Engineering with a Master in Robotics at [KTH Royal Institure of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en). Sometimes I write software or create other things and this page will serve as a collection of all the interesting projects I come in contact with, no matter how small.

It will probably also serve a bit as a personal blog.
